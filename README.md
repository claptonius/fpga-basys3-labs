# FPGA Basys3 Labs

A collection of small FPGA projects built whilst working through
*Digital Design and Computer Architecture (DDCA)* using the Digilent Basys3 board.

Each folder is a short lab exploring a new concept.

## Hardware & Tools

* Basys3 (Artix-7 FPGA)
* Xilinx Vivado
* Verilog HDL

---

## Projects

* **01 — LED Blink**
  Blink an LED using a clock divider.

* **02 — Switch → LED Mirror**
  Wire the 16 slide switches directly to the 16 LEDs.

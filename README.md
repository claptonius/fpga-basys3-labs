# FPGA Basys3 Labs

My learning journey using the Digilent Basys3 FPGA while studying
Digital Design and Computer Architecture (DDCA).

This repository contains small, incremental projects that build from
basic digital logic towards concepts in computer architecture.

---

## Why?

To learn FPGA design step by step while documenting the process.
Each folder represents a small lab that introduces a new concept.

The goals are to:

understand digital logic implemented in hardware

practise Verilog and Vivado

build towards larger and more complex FPGA projects

---

## Hardware & Tools

* **Board:** Digilent Basys3 (Artix-7 FPGA)
* **Software:** Xilinx Vivado
* **Language:** Verilog HDL

## Project Roadmap

### 01 — LED Blinker

Generate a clock divider and blink an LED.

Concepts:

* FPGA clock
* Counters and clock division
* Generating my first bitstream

---

### 02 — Switch to LED Mirror

Connect the 16 slide switches directly to the 16 LEDs.

Concepts:

* FPGA inputs & outputs
* Constraints (XDC)
* Combinational logic

---

### Upcoming Projects

* 03 — 4-bit Binary Adder
* 04 — Signed Overflow Detector
* 05 — 7-Segment Display Driver
* 06 — Binary Counter Demo
* 07 — Mini Calculator


## Vision

Progress from basic digital logic to a simple CPU on FPGA.
